ABP/PPG peak correction
=======================

This document describes how to perform inspection and correction of
automatic peak detection in pulsatile signals.

Description
-----------

This task is a clone of the :doc:`QRS corrector <QRScorrector>` task, for
visual inspection and correction of peaks automatically detected. See
the :doc:`help <QRScorrector>` for further reference and also check
this :ref:`example <PPG_ABP_waves_visual_inspection_and_correction>`.
