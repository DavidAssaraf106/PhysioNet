%% Very simple example of how to use the ecg-kit
% 
% This script exemplifies the use of the ecg-kit in a very short multimodal
% cardiovascular recording which includes arterial blood pressure (ABP),
% plethysmographic (PPG) and electrocardiogram signals. The following tasks
% will be performed in this example:  
% 
% * Heartbeat/QRS detection
% * ABP/PPG pulse detection
% * ECG wave delineation
% * Heartbeat classification
% * Report generation
% 
% Each automatic step is followed by a manual verification step in order to
% verify the algorithm's results.
% 
% You can watch a typical run of this script online
