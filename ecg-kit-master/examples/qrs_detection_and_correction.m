%% Use of ecg-kit for the detection-validation-correction of heartbeats in ECG
% 
%  Brief description:
%  ------------------
% 
% Example or recipe for the detection of heartbeats in a dataset or folder
% containing several ECG recordings. Several features of the toolbox were
% described in previous examples. See other scripts available in this
% folder for further details.
% This example or recipe follows these steps:
% 
%   1- Automatic QRS detection
%       a- wavedet
%       b- gqrs
%       c- AIP
%   2- Merge and selection of the best detection.
%   3- Visual inspection/correction of the results.
%   4- Export the validated detections to a file.
% 
% The goal of this example is showing a method for creating high quality
% detections for research or other purposes.

payload_in.trgt_width = 0.06; % 60 milliseconds width. A narrow and normal QRS complex
% The minimum separation among heartbeats, 300 millisecond allow most of
% the anticipated heartbeats to be detected. MITDB has even more
% anticipated heartbeats, but 300 milliseconds is a decent starting point.
payload_in.trgt_min_pattern_separation = 0.3; % seconds. 
% The longest pause allowed among patterns. By the moment this property is
% unused, but future releases can detect pauses in order to restart the
% pattern search, or relax certain restrictions.
payload_in.trgt_max_pattern_separation = 2; % seconds
% amount of patterns to find, matching the above criteria. Could be related
% to the heartbeats morphologies in QRS detection context.
