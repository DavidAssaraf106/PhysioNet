%% Very simple example of how to use the ecg-kit in a cluster
% 
% This script is the same as "first_simple_example" but it is prepared to
% run locally without arguments, or in a cluster environment by
% using "pid_str" argument. The pid_str argument is a char with format
% 'N/M', being N <= M with default value '1/1'. You can partition a big job
% into M pieces in a cluster architecture, by starting M processes with N
% ranging from 1 to M.
